Hello, I'm Fiona.

I'm a mathematics student interested in stable homotopy theory and low dimensional topology,
as well as mathematical physics, especially quantum computing and TQFTs.

I was formerly in information security, and I still have an interest in formal verification and hardware security.

I play a variety of video games, mostly Team Fortress 2 and osu.

I plan on this site to mostly be an area for me to sketch out things I'm working with or thinking about, and hopefully
provide some helpful expository content along the way.
