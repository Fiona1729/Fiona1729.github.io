Hello, I'm Fiona.

I'm a mathematics PhD student at the University of Strathclyde. I'm broadly interested in 
applying homotopy theory to mathematical physics, mostly from the perspective of cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topoi
and differential cohomology, as well as Calabi-Yau $A_\infty$ categories and Floer homology.

I am employed & funded by [VERSES AI](https://www.verses.ai/) as a researcher in the mathematics 
theory group, where I am currently working on active inference, topological data analysis, and 
applying statistical physics to machine learning.

I was previously in information security, and I still maintain some interest in formal verification
and formal methods in software. This is mostly in the form of category theory intersecting type theory,
with the MSP group at the University of Strathclyde.

In my time outside mathematics I enjoy hiking, cycling, and American Sign Language.
