Hello all, for my first post here I figured I'd write a bit about my hosting of this site.
I'm using Jekyll and Github Pages with the Chirpy theme. You can view the source [here](https://github.com/Fiona1729/Fiona1729.github.io).

The chirpy theme provides support for MathJax out of the box so the only thing I'll be doing externally is some
commutative diagrams, probably with quiver.io or tikz-cd.
