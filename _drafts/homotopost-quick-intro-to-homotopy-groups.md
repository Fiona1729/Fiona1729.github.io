# Overview
Homotopy is an area of mathematics roughly concerned with figuring out which topological spaces are the same, and
various values attached to these spaces that are the same if the two spaces are the same, called homotopy invariants.
The one this post is concerned with is the fundamental group, denoted \\( \\pi_1 \\). As the name fundamental implies, this
is the most core invariant to homotopy theory.

I'm going to assume the reader is at least familiar with a basic concept of topological spaces and continuity in them,
whether this is from a course or a YouTube video on coffee cups being the same as donuts.
